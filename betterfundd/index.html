        <h2>About this project</h2>
        <p>
          We are an independent, non-governmental and non-profit organisation working for the holistic development of parentless children, women and children belonging to vulnerable families. Founded in 1949 in Austria, SOS Children’s Villages began its operations in India in 1964. For over 50 years, we have reached out to over 25,000 children through our 32 SOS Children’s Villages and 32 community projects in India.SOS Children’s Villages of India was established in 1964 at Faridabad near Delhi. SOS India has worked with children, communities, disaster struck and disaster accutane prone areas, giving hope to weary communities and families. SOS India is the largest operation within the SOS International Federation of 134 countries.
At SOS Children’s Villages of India, we are committed to the welfare of parentless and abandoned children and to strengthening families and communities as a preventive measure in the fight against abandonment and social neglect.
The organisation’s work is based on the following four pillars:
The Mother: Every child has a caring parent
Brothers and Sisters: Every child has family ties and he or she grows up with a sense of responsibility and a spirit of sharing
The House: A place where the child feels secure and has a sense of belonging
The Village: A community that surrounds the child so that every child has familial roots
One of the most unique features of SOS Children’s Villages is the home-like environment and the long-term support given to every child under our care up to the age of 24.
